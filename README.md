# Movie-Rental

This program allows the user to check out a pre-determined number of movies and check out with a receipt.
Movie Rental uses a linked list data structure to alphabetize store inventory by genre. The menu selection
allows the user to add movies to the store inventory, display movie selections, create a customer
rental inquiry or end the program. Attached is a .txt file that contains the movie selection.
